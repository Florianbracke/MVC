## The mission
How does one become a good coder? By coding a lot (thanks, captain!).
But coding **all** the time is actually not the best idea.
Spending time with others things will help you reload, but also make you a more well rounded developer in general.
Depending on the client, your hobby, interest or a startup you just saw might be valuable background information instead of being limited to only talk about the technical side.
So let's give our hobbies and interests some attention - prescribed by the coach ðŸ˜‰

Think of a website that'll be related to a cool thing to do - anything works! As long as you stick to the must-haves - and even otherwise, we could always talk.
It can be a platform to meet a new sporting buddy, find the ideal boardgame or to check when the weather is suitable to go for a windsurfing session.

## Must-have features

### Concept & approach
- Don't go for one of the examples, but give your idea some proper thought.
    - How does this bring value to others?
    - What is your target audience? Adjust your features & style for them.
- Discuss your idea with your coach (make sure you have a go before building it)
- Is an MVP approach possible within the timeframe?
    - MVP stands for minimum viable product. It's a way of testing an idea with minimal time and money investment.
    - If time is too short, what phases can you use? What features are crucial, which ones are nice to have and which ones are absolutely optional?
- How will you manage project management?
    - Make a list of your desired features.
    - Approach and platform is free, as long as you can show a clear plan and regularly update it.
    - Don't aim just for the deadline, go for earlier checkpoints. If you notice that the idea if too big two days in, it's way easier to adapt than a day before the deadline.
- Provide an internal debrief at the end of the project.
    - Round table discussion: what went well and what would you do differently next time (both approach & technicalities)? Document your findings.
    - Make a personal feedback form based on this template (will come later). Only you and your coach will have access to the results (don't forget to invite him/her).
    - As your team members for personal feedback on how to grow. This is not a complaints department, but a way of generating valuable tips. Being constructive and honest is the best way to help your peers.

### Structure & technical concepts
- Interact with a database (agree on the structure first, you *might* want to check out import/exports to share structure and contents)
- You can focus on the parts of your application that interest you the most, but I expect everyone to have some understanding of how **all** of the code works. This is an approach that might help with the [bus factor](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/the-bus-factor-6ea1a3ede6bd) in real projects.
- We've been improving our structure gradually by splitting logic and views. Let's take it a step further by experimenting with the MVC pattern. Use [this boilerplate](https://github.com/becodeorg/php-mvc-boilerplate) as inspiration. Any info you get from the database can be converted to a modal to make use of it.
- Starting a bigger project from scratch can be fun, but usually brings a lot of questions "how to do x?" "I found 3 approaches, which one to choose". Take the chance to discuss these moments in your group, or schedule a session with your coach.
- The project applies the best practises for git and PHP. "Where are those again?", you may ask - does this mean you don't have them bookmarked? ðŸ˜‰ (hint: links can be found in the #announcements channel)
- Feel free to explore new techniques in any of the languages we know! Structure wise, I recommend sticking with anything linked discussed before and in these instructions.
